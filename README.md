# Gesture-Controlled-Virtual_Mouse
The purpose of this project is to develop a Virtual Mouse application that targets a few aspects of significant development. 
For starters, this project aims to eliminate the need of having a physical mouse while being able to interact with the computer system through a webcam by using various image processing techniques. 
Other than that, this project aims to develop a Virtual Mouse application that can be operational on all kinds of surfaces and environments.Â
